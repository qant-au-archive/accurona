# Verification

Every Accurona package, and Axonometra, installed from the public npm registry as
a third party would, on one page:

- `@accurona/core` validates a scene and formats lengths,
- `@accurona/ui` draws a tool button that raises a notification,
- `@accurona/elements` supplies the plan drawings, and the scene's icons,
- `@axonometra/editor` opens the scene's floor plan, and keeps its diagram view
  on save.

The Docker image installs with no lockfile and no token, so each build tests what
is published now. It is served under a strict Content-Security-Policy (no
`'unsafe-eval'`, no `fetch()` of `data:`).

```sh
bash verify/restart.sh        # build from npm, serve on http://localhost:2224
node verify/check.mjs         # load it and check every package (Playwright)
```

This folder is not part of any published package.
