# Accurona

The shared core behind [Axonometra](https://github.com/qant-au/axonometra) (floor
plans and 3D) and [Reticulyne](https://github.com/qant-au/reticulyne) (network
diagrams): one source of truth for what the two tools draw, so the same thing looks
and measures the same in both, and so other tools can build on it too.

Today Accurona is the **element library**: furniture, fixtures, comms and security
equipment, with one set of groups, ids and look. It also holds the
[shared keymap](docs/keymap.md) both tools follow, and the
[scene format](docs/scene-format.md): one file for floor plans, isometric and 2D
diagrams, with one stable id per object: the file format both tools open and save,
implemented in `@accurona/core`.
And it holds the [shared UI](#shared-ui): the MUI theme, menus and panels both
tools are built from, so that switching between them needs no retraining.

## Elements

Each element is modelled **once**, as a few simple solids at real size in
centimetres. Every view is generated from that model:

- **Plan** (Axonometra): top-down, true to scale. _Built._
- **Isometric** (Reticulyne): shaded 30° view. _Experimental: generated but
  not yet reviewed item by item._ Needed only for the elements a Reticulyne
  catalogue item draws with (below).
- **3D** (Axonometra's 3D view): the same solids as meshes, from
  `dist/models.json` (solids with colours resolved; decals left out). _Built._
- **2D schematic** (Reticulyne's flat, Visio-style view): not to scale, one
  line weight for every symbol. A ceiling or wall device draws its plan
  pictogram (see Symbols); anything else is seen from the front, with the
  ports, LEDs and bezels on its front face. An element whose telling face is
  its top (a desk phone's keypad) sets `schematic: 'plan'` to draw its
  top-down view instead. _Built; reviewed for the elements a Reticulyne
  catalogue item cross-references._

### What belongs in the library

The library holds **physical things**: anything with a real size that can be
placed on a floor plan. An element has no ports and knows nothing about
connections.

Reticulyne keeps its **own catalogue** of the things a network diagram connects:
devices with their ports, and virtual things that never appear on a floor plan,
such as a cloud service or a VPN link. Ports, media and protocols are defined
there, not here.

Many things belong in both: a switch, an access point, a smoke detector. Each
catalogue keeps its own entry, and the two are related by a **free-form
cross-reference**: an entry names the other catalogue's id, in the same
`{ source, ref }` shape a scene uses for
[links to external tools](docs/scene-format.md#links-back-to-external-tools).
Neither schema depends on it, and a missing or stale reference breaks only
itself. A Reticulyne item that cross-references an element can be drawn with
that element's isometric view (and, in the flat view, its schematic), so a rack is still the same rack, the same size
and colours, on a floor plan and in a network diagram.

## Packages

Three packages on npm, all MIT:

| Package                                                                  | What                                                                     |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`@accurona/elements`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@accurona/elements) | This library, built: `manifest.json`, `models.json`, `plan/<id>.svg`, `iso/<id>.svg` and `schematic/<id>.svg`. |
| [`@accurona/core`](packages/core/)                                       | The scene format (a Zod schema and its JSON Schema), length units and the shared keymap. |
| [`@accurona/ui`](packages/ui/)                                           | The shared MUI theme, menus, panels and notifications.                   |

```sh
npm install @accurona/elements
```

```js
import manifest from '@accurona/elements/manifest.json' with { type: 'json' };
// Each element's plan drawing, e.g. with Vite:
import sofaUrl from '@accurona/elements/plan/sofa-3.svg?url';
```

## Develop

```sh
npm install
npm test                 # rules every element must meet
npm run build            # dist/manifest.json, dist/models.json, dist/plan/<id>.svg, dist/iso/<id>.svg (iso experimental), dist/schematic/<id>.svg
npm run sheet            # review/<group>.png contact sheets
npm run sheet -- comms --iso --schematic
```

A release (a `v*` tag) runs the tests and the build and publishes all three
packages to npm (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`).

## Layout

| Path                             | What                                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| `src/groups.mjs`                 | The groups, in display order.                         |
| `src/elements/<group>.mjs`       | The elements of one group (default export: an array). |
| `src/palette.mjs`                | Colours and line weights.                             |
| `src/render/plan.mjs`, `iso.mjs`, `schematic.mjs` | The three renderers.                   |
| `ITEMS.md`                       | The item list: the ids, names and sizes built from.   |
| `packages/core/`                 | `@accurona/core`: scene format, units, keymap.        |
| `packages/ui/`                   | `@accurona/ui`, the shared UI (below).                |

## An element

```js
{
  id: 'sofa-3',              // kebab-case, unique, never renamed once shipped
  name: 'Sofa, 3-Seat',      // Title Case; a test enforces it
  group: 'living',
  tags: ['network'],         // optional: network, power, cooling, security, fire, av, safe
  size: { w: 210, d: 90, h: 85 },  // cm: width (x), depth (y), height (z)
  mount: 210,                // optional: cm from mountFrom (wall and ceiling gear)
  mountFrom: 'floor',        // optional: 'floor' (default; mount = underside above the floor),
                             //   'ceiling' (mount = gap from the ceiling to the top; 0 = flush)
                             //   or 'surface' (mount = gap above the item it stands on)
  facing: 'up',              // optional: 'up' (default) or 'down', e.g. a dome camera or downlight
  parts: [ /* solids, below */ ],
  plan: [ /* optional decals drawn on top of the plan, in footprint cm */ ],
  symbol: { /* optional: draw on plans as a 40 cm symbol, below */ }
}
```

**Axes.** x runs left to right, y runs **back to front**, z runs up. The back
of the element (the side against a wall) is at y = 0, the top edge of the plan;
the side you use it from faces y = d, the bottom edge. Doors and fronts face the
bottom. In the isometric view the front (y = d) and right (x = w) faces show.

**Mounting and facing.** Parts are always authored facing up, z counting up from the
underside; `facing: 'down'` mirrors them inside the item's height. `mountFrom` and
`facing` are decided in [the scene format](docs/scene-format.md#mounting-and-facing-version-2)
and are in scene format version 2. Every element with a `mount` names its `mountFrom`:
ceiling gear (detectors, dome cameras, access points, ceiling speakers, the AC
cassette, cable tray) is `'ceiling'`, most of it flush (`mount: 0`) and facing down;
wall gear stays `'floor'`. The renderers draw an element as installed:

- **Isometric**: the solids mirrored (a dome hangs below its rim), front and side
  decals mirrored with them, and `top` decals left out, because they are on the
  underside the view cannot see. A down arrow on the top marks the item as facing down.
- **3D** (`models.json`): the solids mirrored; a dome that narrows downwards carries
  `down: true`.
- **Plan**: drawn as authored, because a ceiling item on a plan is read as a reflected
  ceiling plan, looking up at its face. An element with `mountFrom: 'ceiling'` has its
  outline dashed, the reflected-ceiling-plan convention (`planSvg(el, { reflected:
  false })` turns it off).

### Parts

Solids, in cm, all inside `size`, never overlapping each other (the isometric
renderer orders parts by assuming they are separate; overlapping solids draw in
the wrong order).

| Part                               | Shape                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `{ x, y, z, w, d, h, r? }`         | Box. `r` rounds its corners on the plan.                                                  |
| `{ cyl: [cx, cy, rx, ry?], z, h }` | Vertical cylinder, elliptical if `ry` is given.                                           |
| `{ dome: [cx, cy, r], z, h }`      | Dome (camera domes, lights).                                                              |
| `{ poly: [[x, y], ...], z, h }`    | Extruded polygon for L-shapes and curves. List points **clockwise** on the plan (y down). |

Common part options: `role` (fill, default `body`), `outline` (`true` draws
the part with the heavy plan outline; the first part has it unless it sets
`outline: false`), `dash` (a dashed plan outline, e.g. `'6 4'`, for overhead
items such as skylights), and decals per face: `top`, `front`, `side`.

**Roles:** `body`, `soft` (cushions, tops, trays), `dark` (equipment),
`metal`, `wood`, `glass` (glass and water), `plant`, `ground` (rugs, paving).

### Decals

Marks on a face, in cm relative to the face's top-left corner. On `top` that
is the top-left corner of the part's bounding box on the plan (for a `cyl`,
`dome` or `poly`, the box around it, not the plan origin); on `front` and `side`, v runs **down** from the
face's top edge.

| Decal                                                  | Draws                                            |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `{ line: [[u, v], ...], closed? }`                     | Polyline or polygon.                             |
| `{ rect: [u, v, w, h], r? }`                           | Rectangle.                                       |
| `{ circle: [u, v, r] }`, `{ ellipse: [u, v, rx, ry] }` | Circle, ellipse.                                 |
| `{ arc: [cx, cy, r, fromDeg, toDeg] }`                 | Arc (0° = +x, 90° = +y, i.e. towards the front). |

Options: `fill` (a role or accent), `stroke` (a role, `outline` or `detail`;
default `detail`), `accent` (a tag colour, filled, for LEDs and status marks),
`dash`, `weight: 'outline'` (heavy line), and `view: 'plan'` or `'iso'` to
draw in one view only. A decal on `top` that only makes sense seen from above
(louvres, seat lines on an item mounted high) takes `view: 'plan'`.

### Symbols

Ceiling and wall devices (cameras, detectors, access points, sensors, call
points) are far too small to see at plan scale. They set `symbol`, and the plan
draws a **40 × 40 cm** frame with a pictogram instead of the model, while
`size` and `parts` still describe the real device for the isometric and 3D
views.

```js
symbol: {
  frame: 'circle',   // or 'square'
  glyph: [ /* decals in the 40 × 40 box; default stroke is the outline colour */ ]
}
```

Point directional devices (cameras, sirens, exit signs) towards the **bottom**
of the symbol.

## Shared UI

`@accurona/ui` (`packages/ui/`) is what Axonometra and Reticulyne share on
screen. Both use [MUI](https://mui.com); these are the parts that must look and
behave the same in both:

| Export                                 | What                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `createAccuronaTheme(mode)`            | The theme: palette, type, shadows, component defaults.                 |
| `ToolButton`, `ToolMenu`, `Surface`    | Toolbar buttons, a menu that opens on hover or click, their card.      |
| `SidePanel`, `FloatingPanel`           | A panel from the right; a non-modal panel pinned top right (help).     |
| `AppDialog`, `CloseButton`             | A modal with a titled header; every close is named "Close".            |
| `notify()`, `NotificationHost`         | Transient messages, raised from anywhere, including plain classes.     |
| `ContextMenu`                          | The right-click menu on the drawing.                                   |
| `KeyboardShortcutsDialog`              | The `?` list, from the shared keymap, with its Excalidraw differences. |
| `Panel`, `PanelSection`, `PanelHeader` | A properties panel: sticky header, titled sections.                    |

`createAccuronaTheme(mode, { cssVariables })` leaves MUI's CSS variables off
unless asked: MUI writes them to `:root`, which an embedded editor must not do
to its host page. `accuronaThemeOptions(mode)` and `accuronaVars(mode)` give
the same theme as options, for a host that builds its own.

It is built with `tsc` to `packages/ui/dist/` (JavaScript plus types) by
`npm run build`, and takes React, MUI and Emotion as peer dependencies.

## House style

- **Recognisable at 1:50, no more.** A plan is read from across a room, not
  inspected. Aim for 5 to 25 marks per element; the plan SVG must stay under
  4 KB (a test enforces it).
- **Colour carries meaning, sparingly.** Bodies are off-white or grey; accent
  colours mark a device's kind (blue network, orange power, teal cooling, red
  security and fire, purple AV, green safe: first aid and evacuation) in one small place: a status strip, a lens, a
  panel. Never a whole body.
- **Model real sizes.** Take dimensions from common Australian products; the
  sizes in `ITEMS.md` are the brief.
- **Families from functions.** When items differ only in size (beds, racks,
  wardrobes, desks), write one function and call it per size, as
  `bed()` in `bedroom.mjs` and `rack()` in `comms.mjs` do.
